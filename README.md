Creative Dynamic Onboarding Form System
A flexible, secure, and scalable Dynamic Form Platform built for financial services firms to manage customer onboarding (KYC, loans, investments) with full compliance and operational agility.

## Features
** üíª Client Portal & Submission **
Dynamic Form Rendering - Clients see forms generated on-the-fly based on the Admin's configuration, including conditional fields.

Double Submission Prevention - Forms are instantly marked as completed and disabled on the client dashboard after submission to prevent double entry.

Secure Access (JWT) - All client actions (viewing forms, submitting data, viewing history) are protected by JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication.

Submission History - A dedicated tab allows clients to view all their submitted forms and their current status.

‚öôÔ∏è Administrative Agility
Admin Setup (Jazzmin) - Uses a customized Django Admin (Jazzmin UI) for a clean, agile way for non-developers to create and manage forms and fields.

API-First Configuration - Admins define form structure and rules using the system's underlying API model, supporting complex business logic without code changes.

Role-Based Access - Admin endpoints (CRUD on forms/fields, viewing all submissions) are protected by IsAdminUser permissioning.

üíæ Data & File Management
JSONB Flexibility - Submission data is stored in PostgreSQL JSONB fields, ensuring that old submissions remain intact even when the form structure evolves over time.

Cloud File Offloading - Large client documents (ID, proof of income) are stored in AWS S3 to prevent database bloat, ensuring high performance and data durability.

Auditability - Submission records track which form version was used, aiding compliance and auditing.

üîî Asynchronous Workflow
Instant Client Feedback - Uses toast.success for non-intrusive, immediate success notifications upon submission.

Decoupled Notifications - Celery instantly queues a task to notify administrators via Email (SMTP/Gmail) when a new submission arrives, guaranteeing low API submission latency.
